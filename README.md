# Park Freezy
The free and easy parking solution

## Inspiration
We wanted it to be easy to find free and easy parking given a location in Calgary, Alberta, Canada
## What it does
The web app takes in an address as a search parameter and a few filters for the user's desired walking distance, pay preference, and other filters, and then shows a map with a pin of the nearest parking location based on the users parameters.
## How we built it
We built it by connecting a frontend powered by HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, with a Flask python server backend. We also used a library called Leaflet for the map. We took our data from https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/On-Street-Residential-Parking-Zones/2rmy-g65b/about_data, https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/On-Street-Parking-Zones/g33j-xi2h
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to effectively take the data from the CSV data files provided from the Calgary page and be able to filter through them for desired specifications. We were also able to make a pleasing frontend that was smooth and easy for users to use.
